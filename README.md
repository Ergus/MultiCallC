Simple CMake-CTest Project
=========================

This is a simple project to show in how:

* Create a dynamic library with a source and a header in subdirs.

* Create an executable and link it with the library.

* Create automatic tests for the functions in the library in a subdirectory using assert.

* Interface Python-C++ with CTypes for the library compiled with CMake.

* Interface Fortran-C++ with modern Fortran interface and compiled with CMake.

* Interface Ruby-C++ with ffi for the library compiled with CMake.
